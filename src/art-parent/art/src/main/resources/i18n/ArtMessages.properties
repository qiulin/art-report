# ART messages
#
# Enables the ART user interface to be translated into different languages
# This is the file for the default language, English. (UK English)
#
# Created by: ART team (http://art.sourceforge.net)
# Creation date: 2005-02-24
# Updated by: 
# Update date: 2013-11-17
#
# Message key format is, as much as possible, <page>.<context>.<id>
# This may result in duplication of some values, but it makes it easier to  
# review translations and provides context for translators.
#
# To create a new translation,
# - Copy and rename this file to ArtMessages_xx.properties where xx is the 
# ISO code for the new language(e.g. ArtMessages_de.properties for German)
# - Translate the text after the = signs
# - Email the new translation file to smileybits@users.sourceforge.net
# If you used any non ISO-8859 characters, use native2ascii tool to convert the file
# Also see http://art.sourceforge.net/ArtInternationalization.html
#
# To test for yourself, 
# - Copy the new file to WEB-INF/classes/i18n/
# - Log in to ART
# - Type a url like the following in the browser, http://localhost:8080/art/app/reports.do?lang=xx
# - The application should be displayed in the new language for the remainder of the session
# - You can also modify the login.jsp file to add the new language to the languages list.
#
# A comment line begins with the # char
