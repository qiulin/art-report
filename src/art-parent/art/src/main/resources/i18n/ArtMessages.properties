# ART messages

# Enables the ART user interface to be translated into different languages
# This is the file for the default language, English. (mostly UK English, en_UK)
#
# Created by: ART team (http://art.sourceforge.net)
# Creation date: 2005-02-24
# Updated by: 
# Update date: 2013-09-30
#
# Message key format is, as much as possible, <page>.<context>.<id>
# This will result in duplication of some values, where they appear in different
# pages, but it helps to review translations and provide context for translators
#
# To create a new translation,
# Copy and rename this file to ArtMessages_xx.properties where xx is the language ISO code
# (e.g. ArtMessages_de.properties for German), translate the text after the = signs
# and send the new translation file to smileybits@users.sourceforge.net
# If you used any non ISO-8859 characters, use native2ascii tool to convert the file
# Also see http://art.sourceforge.net/ArtInternationalization.html
#
# To test for yourself, copy the new file to WEB-INF/classes/i18n/ and
# set your browser/computer language accordingly.

# A comment line begins with the # char
