   <p>Take the following steps to upgrade an existing ART installation to a more current version.</p> 
   <ul> 
    <li>Download the latest ART version</li> 
    <li>Extract the zip package to a temporary location</li> 
    <li>Review the <strong>changelog.txt</strong> file to see what has changed</li> 
    <li>Backup the ART directory contained on the application server </li> 
    <li>Backup the ART database</li> 
    <li>Connect to the ART database and run any database upgrade scripts included in the download package to bring the ART database up to date</li> 
    <li>Deploy the new <strong>art.war</strong> file to the application server. There are a number of ways to do this. You can do the following if using Apache Tomcat. 
     <ul> 
      <li>Stop Tomcat</li> 
      <li>Delete the art directory and art.war file in the <strong>TOMCAT_HOME\webapps</strong> directory</li> 
      <li>Delete ART's Tomcat cache by deleting the art directory in the <strong>TOMCAT_HOME\work\Catalina\localhost</strong> directory</li> 
      <li>Copy the new art.war file to the webapps directory</li> 
      <li>Start Tomcat </li> 
     </ul> </li> 
    <li>Copy the contents of the backup <strong>art\WEB-INF\work</strong> directory to the new version's work directory</li> 
    <li>If you had modified the <strong>art\WEB-INF\art-custom-settings.json</strong> file, copy the file from the backup directory to the new version directory</li> 
    <li>If you were using the demo HSQLDB database, after running the upgrade scripts on the ArtRepositoryDB database in the backup location, copy the updated files to the <strong>art\WEB-INF\hsqldb</strong> directory of the new version, overwriting the existing files. You can look at the <a class="" href="https://sourceforge.net/p/art/wiki/Tips/">Tips</a> documentation to see how you can upgrade an HSQLDB database.</li> 
    <li>If you had put any <strong>JDBC drivers</strong> in the <strong>art\WEB-INF\lib</strong> directory, copy these drivers from the backup lib directory to the new version's lib directory.</li> 
    <li>Restart Tomcat</li> 
    <li>Clear your browser's cache e.g. for Firefox, use the History | Clear Recent History menu</li> 
   </ul> 
   <p>The upgrade is complete. All users, reports, scheduled jobs etc should continue to work as before.</p> 
   <h2 id="notes">Notes</h2> 
   <p>Some upgrades may require special attention or additional effort due to feature changes and incompatibilities with previous versions.</p> 
   <h3 id="30">3.0</h3> 
   <p>ART 3.0 is a major upgrade and may require extensive testing to verify that it continues to fulfill the needs of an existing installation.</p>
