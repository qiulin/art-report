<p>
	Welcome to the ART Reporting Tool. You need to configure the
	<b>ART Database</b> before being able to use ART. The ART Database
	stores data used by the application e.g. users, report definitions etc.
</p>
<p>
	After saving the ART Database configuration, use the
	<b>Configure | Users</b> menu to create some users. Create at least
	one Super Admin user which you can use to administer all aspects
	of the application. After creating users, <b>Log Out</b> and log in 
	using one of the users, and continue using the application.
</p>
<p>
	A demo database is provided with a few sample reports.
	To use it, select <b>Demo</b> as the Database Type and Save,
	The demo database has 2 users with username/password of admin/admin
	and auser/auser.
